Renal lithiasis, a medical condition characterized by the formation of kidney stones, is a significant global health challenge. The stones, primarily composed of minerals like calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus, cause excruciating pain as they pass through the urinary tract. Factors such as dehydration, dietary practices, genetic predisposition, and age influence susceptibility to renal lithiasis, with a particular preference among the male demographic. Early and accurate detection of kidney stones is crucial for timely and effective medical interventions. This research advances nephrology diagnostics by proposing a sophisticated approach using deep learning methodologies. The methodology includes convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, and MobileNetV2 models trained on a large dataset of medical images. The CNN model achieved an unparalleled accuracy rate of 97%, followed by the VGG16 model with a commendable accuracy of 99%. The MobileNetV2 model also achieved a notable accuracy rate of 97%. This high level of precision in discerning renal anomalies demonstrates the potential of CNN as a diagnostic tool, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of renal lithiasis diagnoses. This application of deep learning technology not only demonstrates the prowess of artificial intelligence in medical imaging but also holds profound implications for personalized medicine. The successful integration of these models into clinical practice signifies a paradigm shift in renal lithiasis diagnostics, offering a more refined and targeted approach to patient care.
